						<p className="bold-header">My Approach</p>
						<p>I know that being genuinely listened to and supported to see that your thoughts and feelings are valid can help you to make changes both within yourself and in your life. I wonâ€™t tell you how you should feel or what you should do. But I may offer resources that can help you deepen your understanding of yourself, your situation or the choices you can make.</p>
						<p>Because I have completed training in more than one type of therapy, I can adapt my way of working to help clients express their feelings in a way that feels comfortable and constructive for them. My primary training is in person-centred therapy and is at the heart of whatever approach I use. Many studies show that offering this type of authentic, collaborative counselling relationship best supports people to grow, heal and discover new perspectives.</p>
